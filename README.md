## ðŸ§  About

**cyanide-tablets** is my personal collection of dotfiles built around [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland), a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor. This setup focuses on minimal aesthetics, practical usability, and performance. It includes configurations for Hyprland, Waybar, Kitty, Neovim, and more â€“ all tied together in a cohesive, keyboard-driven environment.
